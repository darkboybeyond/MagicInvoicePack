### 💡 Why $450 USD is the Best Option:
When pricing the **#MagicInvoicePack** at **$450 USD**, think about the alternatives:

- **Unlock Multiple Devices**: You’re not just unlocking **one device** but gaining access to a full package that can help with **multiple devices** from **Apple**, **Xiaomi**, and other manufacturers.
- **Risk of Cheaper Services**: Lower prices, like **$100 USD per device**, may seem attractive, but they often **devalue the hard work** involved in **iCloud unlocking** or **Proof of Purchase recovery**. Many people offering low prices may use unreliable methods, leading to **re-locks** or device **blacklisting**.
- **Protect Your Investment**: By paying **$450 USD**, you're ensuring that your **device’s unlock or PoP recovery is handled professionally**, with real **MagicFiles** based on legitimate data.

Would you rather pay **$100 USD** for a **cheap service** and risk getting locked again, or make a **one-time payment of $450 USD** to unlock **multiple devices** with security? Buying a new device, especially an iPhone, can cost upwards of **$1000 USD**, so it’s not worth risking your current investment with unreliable methods.
