# ✨ MagicInvoicePack – Recover Proof of Purchase | iCloud Unlock | Find My Deactivation | Multi-OEM Support ✨

Welcome to **MagicInvoicePack**, your trusted solution for recovering lost or damaged **Proof of Purchase (PoP)** across a wide range of devices, including **Apple 🍏**, **Xiaomi 📱**, **Huawei 🛠️**, **Motorola 📲**, **Samsung 📦**, and many other OEMs. Whether you're handling warranty claims, returns, replacements, or need official support with **iCloud unlock 🔓**, **Find My iPhone deactivation 📳**, or **Activation Lock removal 🚫**, our package has you covered.

## 💼 Features:
- **📝 Recover Proof of Purchase (PoP):** Restore essential purchase details for warranties, returns, replacements, or sales.
- **🔓 iCloud Unlock & Activation Lock Removal:** Request official **iCloud** deactivation, disable **Find My**, or remove **Activation Lock** with verified data.
- **🌍 Multi-OEM Support:** In addition to Apple devices, we support brands such as **Xiaomi**, **Huawei**, **Motorola**, **Samsung**, and more.
- **📊 Real Data from Purchased Devices:** We use legitimate data from real devices to generate **MagicFiles**, ensuring the information is accurate and ready for official requests.

## 💳 Payment Structure:
Our new pricing model ensures sustainability and ongoing updates for users. Here’s how it works:

1. **💼 Package Price**: The complete **MagicInvoicePack** is available for **$450 USD** (non-negotiable). This is a one-time purchase granting access to the package.
2. **💸 MagicFiles Pricing**: Each **MagicFile** costs **$45 USD per device**, with a minimum of 5 devices required for any request.
3. **📈 Minimum & Maximum Requests**: The minimum request is for **5 devices** per order. You can request a maximum of **20 devices per month**. In case of rejections, all relevant information (proof of purchase, email, phone number, and any details used in the rejected Apple or OEM case) must be provided to proceed with the request.
4. **🚫 No Refund Policy**: Please note that **no refunds** will be provided once the package is acquired. Ensure that you understand the terms before making a purchase.

## 🔄 Why We Moved to a Paid Model:
We initially offered **standard** and **pro** versions of the package with free updates and MagicFiles, but this led to financial losses. Moving forward, the subscription and payment structure allows us to continuously maintain and update the package. Subscribers receive fresh **MagicFiles** monthly, ensuring official requests (iCloud unlock, Find My deactivation, Proof of Purchase recovery) are successful.

## ⏳ Turnaround Time:
File processing may take up to **5-7 business days**, excluding weekends. We prioritize accuracy, ensuring the data provided minimizes rejection risk.

## 📢 Important Notes:
- We cannot control how **Apple** or other OEMs will respond to your request. The acceptance or rejection of your **Proof of Purchase** is entirely up to them.
- The **MagicInvoicePack** is **not a tool**. It strictly assists in recovering lost or damaged **Proof of Purchase** details, and misuse of **MagicFiles** is the sole responsibility of the user.
